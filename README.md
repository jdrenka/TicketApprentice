## Alpha Brains - COSC 310 Group Project

Our project is an **event ticketing software** that allows event organizers to easily sell tickets online. Users on our page can create and customize events, as well as browse events close to their location. Event organizers have the ability to include key information such as event **date, time, description, location and ticket price**. 

## How to run the application
1) Clone GitHub repository to IDE (VS Code) - [How to clone here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/javascript/how-to/with-visual-studio-code/clone-github-repository?tabs=activity-bar).
2) Open system terminal (CTRL + ` ) and type ```npm install``` to install dependancies.
3) Locate app.js in the VS code file explorer and Right Click -> Open in Integrated Terminal.
4) Type in console ```node app.js```.
