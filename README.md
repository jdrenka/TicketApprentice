## Alpha Brains - COSC 310 Group Project

Our project is an **event ticketing software** that allows event organizers to easily sell tickets online. Users on our page can create and customize events, as well as browse events close to their location. Event organizers have the ability to include key information such as event **date, time, description, location and ticket price**.
