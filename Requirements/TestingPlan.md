## Testing Plan
Unit Testing will be done by using Mocha. Mocha is a testing framework for Javascript and will work seamlessly with our node.js project. Any components that we code from now on we will run unit tests using Mocha. This will cover all aspects of the code and we will make sure to include edge cases. This will ensure that all our components will work as expected together and it will increase the system's functionality.

JSDOM has been installed to the project in order to simulate a browser so we can test the front end components of the website. This will work seamlessly with Mocha and it will allow us to cover all the HTML components to make sure they are working properly. 

Using these technologies, our plan is to conduct unit testing, integration testing, system testing and acceptance testing to ensure that the software that we produce is valid. We will try to address issues during development so we donâ€™t run into bigger issues later on. 

Tests to be performed: Unit tests, UI testing, security testing, coverage testing, acceptance testing.

Environments tested: Windows 10, Mac, Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari.

Criteria: Document what is tested using comments, tests are reviewed by the team using pull requests, use TDD (test driven development) to develop our software.
